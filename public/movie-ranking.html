<h1>The Best Movies According To Abhinav</h1>

<h2>My Top three movies of All Time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Uri: The Surgical Strike</h3>
<p>I like the spirit of patriotism in this movie.<br /> The acting of Vicky Kaushal was so amazing that I felt the movie to the bottom of my heart</p>

<h3>Dear Comerade</h3>
<p>This movie is the best explanation to a perfct love story.<br />The characters are also lovely and the sense of responsibility of an individual is also well explained.</p>

<h3>Kesari</h3>
<p>A very good story and visualization of a true story of Battle of Saragarhi.</p>
